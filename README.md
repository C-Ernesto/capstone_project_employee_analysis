# capstone_project_employee_analysis

This dataset analyzes an employee dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawfikelmetwally/employee-dataset

We look at any relevant connections between columns and try to identify any interesting trends or features that would give us some insight into the company. Moreso, we wanted to find any relationship between employees leaving and their attributes to see if any columns were indicative of an employee leaving.
